		<h1 class="cText">Setting the Scene</h1>
		<p class="heroText">
			Four parts make up the captivating and simple poem "The Road Not Taken". <br>
			Each section has five lines that rhyme in the pattern ABAAB. The poem has a rhythm that, when read aloud, <br>
			has the feel of a conversation, which heightens its relatability. <br>
			The poem takes us to a peaceful moment in the woods through vivid descriptions, inspiring us to imagine a peaceful scene. <br>

		<h1 class="cText">The Irony of Choice</h1>
		<p class="heroText">
			This poem, however, is frequently misunderstood. <br>
			Many people view it as an ode to individualism that encourages us to carve out our own paths and take unique decisions in life. <br>
			But upon closer inspection, we detect an ironic undertone. The speaker claims that by taking the less-traveled path, <br>
			they took a risky and unusual course of action. <br>
			However, earlier in the poem, we find that both paths had nearly identical signs of wear and deterioration. <br>
			As a result, the idea that one path is truly special or unique comes off as a joke. <br>
		</p>

	<div class="poemContainer">
		<h1 class="cText"> A Playful Message</h1>
		<p class="heroText">
			In reality, the poem was written as a lighthearted joke for a friend who struggled with decision-making, particularly when faced with multiple options. <br>
			It playfully suggests that regardless of the path we choose, there will always be something valuable left behind on the alternative route. <br>
			This concept of missed opportunities adds a touch of wisdom to the poem's message. When we reach the final stanza, the mention of a "sigh" leaves room for contemplation.<br>

	<div class="poemContainer">
		<h1 class="cText">Contemplating Perspectives</h1>
		<p class="heroText">
			It could be seen as an expression of regret for the road not taken or as a contented acceptance of the chosen path. <br>
			This ambiguity deepens the poem, encouraging introspection.<br>
			Furthermore, the speaker's current perspective differs from what they might say in the future. <br>
			This subtle contrast adds another layer of complexity to the poem's meaning.<br>
			It hints that the speaker, reflecting on their experiences, may develop a different understanding of their choices and the paths they have taken. <br>
			It raises the possibility that hindsight could reshape their perception, leading to a nuanced interpretation of their personal journey.<br>

	<div class="poemContainer">
		<h1 class="cText">Challenging Assumptions and Embracing Uncertainty</h1>
		<p class="heroText">
			"The Road Not Taken" encapsulates profound ideas within its brevity. <br>
			Through its skillful use of rhyme, rhythm, and imagery, it challenges our assumptions about individualism and decision-making.<br>
			It reminds us that life is filled with choices, and regardless of the path we choose, there will always be unexplored aspects. <br>
			Let us approach our own journeys with curiosity, embracing the uncertainties that lie ahead and cherishing the unique experiences that unfold along the way.<br>
