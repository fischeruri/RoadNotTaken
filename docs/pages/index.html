                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
                And sorry I could not travel both<br />
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
                And looked down one as far as I could<br />
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
                <br />
                Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
                Though as for that the passing there<br />
                Had worn them really about the same,<br />
                <br />
                And both that morning equally lay<br />
                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
                I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
                <br />
                I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
                I took the one less traveled by,<br />
                And that has made all the difference.<br />
